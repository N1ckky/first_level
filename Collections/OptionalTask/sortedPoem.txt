Somewhere ages and ages hence:
I took the one less traveled by,
And both that morning equally lay
And be one traveler, long I stood
And sorry I could not travel both
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Had worn them really about the same.
Though as for that the passing there
And having perhaps the better claim,
To where it bent in the undergrowth.
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And that has made all the difference.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I doubted if I should ever come back.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And looked down one as far as I could
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
